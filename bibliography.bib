  abstract = {Natural language is an easy and effective medium for describing visual
	ideas and mental images. Thus, we foresee the emergence of language-based
	3D scene generation systems to let ordinary users quickly create
	3D scenes without having to learn special software, acquire artistic
	skills, or even touch a desktop window-oriented interface. WordsEye
	is such a system for automatically converting text into representative
	3D scenes. WordsEye relies on a large database of 3D models and poses
	to depict entities and actions. Every 3D model can have associated
	shape displacements, spatial tags, and functional properties to be
	used in the depiction process. We describe the linguistic analysis
	and depiction techniques used by WordsEye along with some general
	strategies by which more abstract concepts are made depictable.},
